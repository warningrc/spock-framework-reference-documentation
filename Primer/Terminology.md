>Let’s start with a few definitions: Spock lets you write specifications that describe expected features (properties, aspects) exhibited by a system of interest. The system of interest could be anything between a single class and a whole application, and is also called system under specification (SUS). The description of a feature starts from a specific snapshot of the SUS and its collaborators; this snapshot is called the feature’s fixture.
