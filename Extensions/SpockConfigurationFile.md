# Spock Configuration File
----
Some extensions can be configured with options in a Spock configuration file. The description for each extension will mention how it can be configured. All those configurations are in a Groovy file that usually is called `SpockConfig.groovy`. Spock first searches for a custom location given in a system property called `spock.configuration` which is then used either as classpath location or if not found as file system location if it can be found there, otherwise the default locations are investigated for a configuration file. Next it searches for the `SpockConfig.groovy` in the root of the test execution classpath. If there is also no such file, you can at last have a `SpockConfig.groovy` in your Spock user home. This by default is the directory `.spock` within your home directory, but can be changed using the system property `spock.user.home` or if not set the environment property `SPOCK_USER_HOME`.
